This is the Color Scheme I started using when I first started learning Android seven years ago, I don't know who it's author is, but I'm grateful for such a beautiful color scheme, and with the update to Android Studio, it's starting to have It didn't fit at all, so I adjusted some settings, and now it works perfectly on my device, if you find any problems when using it, you can post an issue and I'll try to adjust it.
